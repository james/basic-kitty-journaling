Forked from [Dan Catt's Kitty](https://github.com/revdancatt/basic-kitty-journaling), this is Ducky, James Darling's personal AI assistant.

The code is open, but I have not put any effort into making it reusable. This is coding in the open, not open source. Feel free to read through, but I don't reccomend using it.

Setup:

```
bundle
brew install keith/formulae/reminders-cli
```
