/*

Hey there,

This is a very quickly thrown together script to showing using gpt-4 generating journaling questions.

This has been written as a script that runs from top to bottom each time rather than a
more properly structured program. This is just to show how it works in concept, if you
wanted to expand on this you'd want to make it more modular.

Good luck!
