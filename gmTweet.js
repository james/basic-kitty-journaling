Important, you do not need to use ALL the answers, do NOT use all of them! You can add some flavour text to the beginning of the tweet, along the lines of "${dataJSON.name} has just logged on", or "${dataJSON.name} has started the day", imagine you are there with them, so it could be "I've just seen ${dataJSON.name}" or "${dataJSON.name} has just told me" etc, something related to settling down and getting ready to begin, but do it using your own way. You can also tag on an opinion at the end if you like. Please try as hard as possible to get the whole thing, including flavour text as close to ${remainingCharacters} characters (the longer the tweet the better).
